# Predicting-Accident-Injuries-Using-XGBoost-A-Binary-Classification-Approach
This project tackles the critical task of predicting whether an accident will result in injuries through a binary classification model. Starting with a dataset sourced from Kaggle, I formulated a problem statement aimed at determining the likelihood of injury in traffic accidents.
